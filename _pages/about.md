**Hi there!**

I am a passionate economist specializing in **macroeconomics**, **monetary policy**, and **business cycle analysis**. My research leverages cutting-edge methods including **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, and **(Bayesian) vector autoregression** to explore economic questions.

Currently pursuing my **Ph.D. in Economics** at the University of Bern, I bring a diverse educational background and practical experience to my work. My academic journey has taken me from [**The School of Management Fribourg**](https://www.heg-fr.ch/en/) over **Boston University** to the [**University of Bern**](https://www.vwi.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), with a valuable research visit at the **Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis**. This international exposure combined with my 10-year experience at the **Freiburger Kantonalbank**, a mid-sized bank in Switzerland, provides me with a unique perspective on global as well as Swiss economic issues.

My research projects reflect my interests in the intersection of monetary policy, natural language processing, and the real-financial nexus of the economy. My ongoing work includes:

1. Using Natural Language Processing to Identify Monetary Policy Shocks
2. Costs of Leaning Against the Wind: Evidence from a High-Frequency Identification Approach
3. Anatomy of the Real-Financial Nexus

These projects demonstrate my ability to conduct **rigorous quantitative analyses** and derive **policy-relevant insights**.

During my time at the University of Bern, I've had the priviledge of teaching various economic courses. This experience has honed my ability to communicate complex economic concepts clearly and effectively.

My **language skills** include native German, excellent English and French, and intermediate Spanish, enabling effective communication in diverse international settings.
