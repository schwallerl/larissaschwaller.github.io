**Hi there!**

&nbsp;  
I am a fourth year PhD Candidate in Economics at the [University of Bern](https://www.vwi.unibe.ch/index_eng.html), specializing in macroeconomic, monetary policy, business cycle analysis, and machine learning. My research focuses on utilizing quantitative methods to address macroeconomic questions, reflecting my passion for data analysis.

Prior to my PhD studies, I interned at the Economic Analysis Unit of the Swiss National Bank. During my Bachelor's and Master's studies, I worked part-time as a credit assistant at the Freiburger Kantonalbank, a medium-sized bank in Switzerland.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about myself and my research.
