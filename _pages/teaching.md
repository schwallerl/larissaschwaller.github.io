**Seminar in Macroeconomics and International Economics**<br>
Master course, spring 2023 & 2024

*Course description*:   The aim of the seminar is to introduce students to best research practice in macroeconomics. It is a challenging seminar as it relies on both theoretical (modeling) and applied (computational and econometric) tools. The students have to select (either solo or in a group) a paper from a list of works that have been published in leading international economic journals. They have to read and understand the paper, solve the model, and replicate (or, extend) its main results using Dynare, a Matlab based toolkit for solving and simulating dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. The students receive the necessary training and help to accomplish this task. Upon completion of the task, they write a short paper on the selected subject and present it in class.
