**Using Natural Language Processing to Identify Monetary Policy Shocks**

with [Alexandra Piller](http://alexandrapiller.ch/) and [Marc Schranz](https://marc-schranz.github.io/)

High-frequency changes in federal funds futures prices around Federal Open Market Committee announcements have become an important tool for identifying the effects of monetary policy on macroeconomic variables. However, a number of recent studies have pointed out that these measures of monetary policy surprises suffer from endogeneity issues when employed to instrument monetary policy shocks. Using state-of-the-art text analysis methods, we create a new monetary policy surprise series that filters out the changes in federal funds futures (FFF) prices that are solely due to the corresponding FOMC statement and not due to other confounding factors. When identifying the impulse responses to a monetary policy shock based on our monetary policy surprises, we obtain two key results. First, the estimated effects on the macroeconomy are substantially larger than when using prevalent monetary policy surprises. Second, the persistence of the two-year Treasury yield response is considerably lower.

**Costs of Leaning Against the Wind: Evidence from a High-Frequency Identification Approach**

with Lucas Kyriacou

What are the economic costs central banks face when they attempt to curb housing prices or credit aggregates through adjustments in the interest rate? This study provides a measure of these costs by combining state-of-the-art estimation and identification methods with monetary policy surprises from Bauer and Swanson (2023) as an external instrument. Our analysis reveals that the Federal Reserve would have to tolerate a one percent reduction in real GDP to achieve a mere four percent decrease in real housing prices. Similarly, a real GDP loss of one percent would only lead to a modest reduction of approximately 1.6 percent in real credit. These findings underscore the limited ability of the Federal Reserve to address imbalances in asset prices or credit markets by highlighting the substantial real economic consequences of leaning against the wind policies. Our results align with the majority of the existing literature

**Anatomy of the Relationship between the Real and the Financial Side of the Economy**

In this paper, we use the novel empirical method proposed by Angeletos, Collard, and Dellas (2020) to
comprehensively characterize the interaction between the real side of the economy and the financial sector.
We find that different financial variables are driven by different factors over the business cycle. There does
not appear to exist a main financial shock analogous to the main business cycle shock identified by Angeletos
et al. (2020). By separating the household and the firm credit channels, we observe that the firm channel plays
a more important role in explaining the comovement of macroeconomic variables than the household channel.
We further provide evidence supporting the existence of a financial accelerator mechanism in the data. This
finding is highly informative for theory and lends credibility to approaches that consider financial frictions
an integral part of the model. Additionally, we question whether real macroeconomic aggregates are (solely)
driven by a financial shock over the business cycle. Moreover, we illustrate that business cycle fluctuations in
stock prices are disconnected from current technology but contain non-trivial statistical information about
long-run total factor productivity. In contrast, long-run stock price movements appear entirely driven by
fundamentals. We also show that the term structure does not appear to be a significant factor in explaining
business cycle fluctuations. Finally, we display a tight connection between business confidence and real
macroeconomic aggregates. Still, we rule out exogenous changes to the Business Confidence Index as the
factor driving the majority of business cycle fluctuations in real macroeconomic variables.
